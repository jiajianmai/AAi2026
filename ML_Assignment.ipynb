        "The predicted churn value produced by the linear regression model represents the estimated likeihood that a customer will leave the company. Since the target variable Churn Value which is encoded as 0 meaning customer stays and 1 is when customer leaves. The model outputs a numerical valye that can be interpreted aas a possiblity score. If a model predicts 0.65 this mean they have a 65% chance that the customer will churn. Values that are closr to 1 indicate higher churn risk while values closer to 0 means lower risk.\n",

        "Businesses can use this churn probability to take proactive retention actions. Customers with high predicted churn risk can be targeted with persoanlized strategies such as discounts, loyalty rewards,contract incentives, improved custmer support or promotions. If customers with month to month contracts and high monthly charges show higher churn probabilities, the company could offer discounted long term plans to encourage retention. If we identify at risk customersearly and intervening, businesses can reduce churn and increase overall customer lifetime value."
